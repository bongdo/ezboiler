# Keep config.js for now? No, usually secrets.
# But config.js contains API Key which is public for Firebase usually.
# However, env.local was source.
# Let's ignore it if we want to be safe, but for a public static site it MUST be committed or injected during build.
# Since this is a static site repo for GH Pages, config.js MUST be committed.
